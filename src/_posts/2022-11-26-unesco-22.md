As part of the "Université de la terre" 2022, organised at Unesco, Paris, I was able to take part in panelist discussion, for general audience, on the problems of trust in the digital world (in the broadest sense). The topics discussed during these 90 minutes (which went by very quickly) went far beyond the issues of Trustworthy A.I.: ethical issues (represented by Jean-Gabriel Ganascia), data collection and storage (thanks to Marie Even, deputy general manager of CDiscount), but also longer-term reflections (thanks to Constance Bommelaer de Leusse, executive director of the McCourt Institute) and a broader view of the mechanisms of our digital world (with the journalist Guillaume Pitron).

Aimed at a wide audience, this university dealt with themes that went far beyond the digital world. Our panelist discussion therefore focused on the societal changes brought by the rapid evolution of digital technologies and (of course) A.I. On this last topic, we discussed the existing biases in machine learning models and, above all, the existence of solutions to fix them (let's embrace a positive message!). Time was short, but it must be said that we have scanned the digital world from the internet pipes to the most advanced applications of A.I. (it was thus not so surprizing that time has flown!).

A big thanks to Kedge Business School, partner of the event and of the Trustworthy AI Chair that I pilot at the Bordeaux University Foundation, for allowing me to participate in these rich, stimulating and exciting exchanges.
